# ExcelPSLib
ExcelPSLib is a PowerShell Module that allows creation of XLSX file by using the EPPlus 4.1 .Net Dynamic Link Library available at http://epplus.codeplex.com/ and made by Jan Kallman.

I've started this project because I wanted to improve and automate XLSX report creation and manipulation.
There are known issues and limitations but in general it is fine to use it in production.

Enjoy !
